# First simple React App

Project given by Scrimba as solo project.

Used Create-React-App to setup the initial files.

The App is a very simple travel journal. Design template from Figma https://www.figma.com/file/bVoOJuDmcpNjZz3NzJeoRq/Travel-Journal-(Copy)?node-id=2%3A2 

Data with the trip details is pulled from a data.js file. (no API was used at this point)
